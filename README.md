# Kindle clippings exported

This tool is **boring software**:
1. Input your Kindle clippings file
2. Filter whatever you want to export
3. Select an export format and export

That's it.
No backend, no AI, no images, no login, no cookies, no tracking, no stats, no achievements, no streak.
Just a plain boring tool that works when you need it.

## TODOs
 - [x] Bind DOM manipulation methods after module init using higher order functions
 - [x] Make sure filtering works
 - [x] Make basic exporter with Rust
 - [ ] Make parsing work with my own clipping file
 - [ ] Style the content div a bit
 - [ ] Have a look on mobile
 - [ ] Clean and publish ?
